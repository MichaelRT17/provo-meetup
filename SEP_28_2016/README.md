# Number Summing

1. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n

2. Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17


# List Concat

1. Write a function that concatenates two lists.

2. Write a function that combines two lists by alternating elements from two lists, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] â†’ [a,1,b,2,c,3].

~~Hint: see [Comprehensions](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/comprehensions.html) in the Elixir Guides.~~
Hint: Use [|] pattern for prepending elements to a list.  Ex. [1, 2 | [3,4]] => [1,2,3,4]

# List Element Count

1. Write a program that returns a count of the elements in a list with a built in Elixir function.

2. Write the same above using recursion (i.e. when a function calls itself)
