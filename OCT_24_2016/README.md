Write a function that uses Stream.cycle/1 with a list of words to generate a

# Word Counter

Using GenStage and Flow (see http://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/
  and https://github.com/elixir-lang/gen_stage) create a word counter of the file
  created in the previous task.  Add a timer to benchmark the counter.  Try
  the different ways of implementing a word counter to compare their benchmarks.
